Session Material for Biml session for DataMinds.be
It contains a SQL DDL script to create the metadata database, along with the necessary artifacts (tables, views, stored procs) for working with Biml.

There are also a couple of PowerPoints from various sessions. The Basics and the Beyond the Basics decks combined are the full Dataminds Biml session (in other words, there is one full deck that has been split into two decks: the introduction and the more advanced material).
